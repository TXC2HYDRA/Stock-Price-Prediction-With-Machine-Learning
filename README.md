# Stock-Price-Prediction-With-Machine-Learning

1) TESLA Dataset
   The code predicts Tesla's stock price using linear regression, loading and preprocessing historical data from 2010 to 2020. It splits the data into training and testing sets, scales features using StandardScaler, and trains the linear regression model. The code visualizes the results using Plotly, displaying the actual and predicted stock prices. It also shows the stock price trend over time, highlighting the model's performance. The dataset contains 2416 entries, with features like Date, Open, High, Low, Close, Adj Close, and Volume. The model's evaluation metrics, such as mean squared error and R-squared, can be calculated for further analysis.
