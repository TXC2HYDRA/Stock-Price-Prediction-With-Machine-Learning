#1) TSLA DATASET

So, you want to predict Tesla's stock price using a linear regression model? Well, let's break down the code step by step to see how it's done.

First, we need to get our data in order

We start by importing the necessary libraries and loading a CSV file that contains Tesla's stock data from 2010 to 2020. Then, we take a peek at the data to get a sense of what we're working with.

Next, we prep our data for the model

We convert the 'Date' column into a format that's easier to work with, and then we select the index (which represents time) as our input feature and the 'Close' price as our target variable. Think of it like setting the stage for our model to shine.

Now, let's split our data into training and testing sets

We use a technique called train-test splitting to divide our data into two parts: one for training our model and another for testing its performance. This helps us avoid overfitting and ensures our model is robust.

Time to scale our features

We use a StandardScaler to make sure all our features are on the same playing field. This helps our model perform better and makes it easier to interpret the results.

Now, let's train our linear regression model

We create a linear regression model and fit it to our training data. This is where the magic happens, and our model starts to learn the patterns in the data.

Finally, let's visualize our results

We use Plotly to create a scatter plot that shows our training data and the fitted linear regression line. This gives us a visual representation of how well our model is performing and helps us identify any areas for improvement.

And that's it! By following these steps, we've built a simple linear regression model that can predict Tesla's stock price based on time. Of course, this is just the beginning, and there are many ways to improve and refine our model. But for now, let's take a step back and admire our handiwork.
